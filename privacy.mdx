## Encryption

Every conversation and attachment with Highlight Chat is encrypted, and engineers do not have the ability or authority to access conversations.

## We do not sell your data

Your data is never for sale. We will never sell your data—now or in the future.

## How it works

Highlight never remotely accesses your data. Your data stays local and only necessary data (your question, the attached context, etc.) is sent to our servers in the following scenarios:

- When submitting a chat request just your question and attached context is sent to our LLM partners. Our partners do not store your data, unless it is flagged for safety concerns.
- When audio cloud sync and transcription are enabled, we send your audio to a remote model for transcription. The audio transcript is encrypted before storage, and we never store your audio. At the end of your audio note, we send the entire transcription to our LLM partners for summarization. You can disable these features and have a fully local audio experience by disabling the Cloud Sync and Transcription option in the audio settings. With local mode, your audio transcript is stored locally, and a local model is used for transcription.
- If you have Automatic Task Detection enabled, which will use cloud based AI servers to detect tasks assigned to you.

## The Future

Our goal is to continue to be the most secure way to interact with LLMs. If you’d like to help us achieve that, join our Discord
