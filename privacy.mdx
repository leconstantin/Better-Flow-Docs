## Encryption

Every message, article, and file in Better Flow is encrypted in transit and at rest. Our engineers do not have the ability or authority to access your newsroom's content or communications.

## We do not sell your data

Your data is never for sale. We will never sell your personal information or content what's yours stays yours, always and completely.

## How it works

Better Flow operates with enterprise-grade security standards. Your newsroom data is protected through the following measures:

- All communications between team members are encrypted end-to-end, ensuring only authorized users can access conversations and collaborative content.
- Article drafts, media files, and team discussions are stored with military-grade encryption and backed up securely across multiple data centers.
- User authentication uses industry-standard protocols, and we maintain detailed audit logs for compliance and security monitoring.
- File uploads including images and videos are scanned for security threats before being encrypted and stored in your private workspace.

## The Future

Our goal is to continue being the most secure publishing workflow platform for newsrooms worldwide. We're committed to maintaining the highest privacy standards as we grow. If you have questions about our privacy practices, contact our support team anytime.
