## Accessing the API

The Better Flow API is available via our [web console](https://your-console-link.com). You can try out API requests directly in the browser using our [Workbench](https://your-workbench-link.com) and generate API keys in [Account Settings](https://your-account-settings-link.com). Use [workspaces](https://your-workspaces-link.com) to organize your API keys and [control usage and limits](https://your-rate-limits-link.com) by project or use case.

## Authentication

All requests to the Better Flow API must include an `x-api-key` header with your API key. If you are using our Client SDKs, the API key is set when creating the client, and the SDK automatically includes the header with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you must include the header manually.

## Content Types

The Better Flow API accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in responses. Ensure you send the `content-type: application/json` header in your requests. The Client SDKs handle this automatically.

## Request Size Limits

The API has a maximum request size of **32 MB** for standard endpoints. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a `413 request_too_large` error. Specific endpoints may have different limits:

- **Standard endpoints**: 32 MB
- **Batch endpoints**: 256 MB
- **File uploads**: 500 MB

## Response Headers

Every API response includes the following headers:

- `request-id`: A globally unique identifier for the request.
- `betterflow-organization-id`: The organization ID associated with the API key used for the request.
