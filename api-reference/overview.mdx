## Accessing the API

The API is made available via our web [Console](https://console.anthropic.com/). You can use the [Workbench](https://console.anthropic.com/workbench) to try out the API in the browser and then generate API keys in [Account Settings](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys). Use [workspaces](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/workspaces) to segment your API keys and [control spend](/en/api/rate-limits) by use case.

## Authentication

All requests to the Anthropic API must include an `x-api-key` header with your API key. If you are using the Client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you'll need to send this header yourself.

## Content types

The Anthropic API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the `content-type: application/json` header in requests. If you are using the Client SDKs, this will be taken care of automatically.

## Request size limits

The API has a maximum request size of 32 MB for standard endpoints, including the Messages API and Token Counting API. If you exceed this limit, you'll receive a 413 `request_too_large` error from Cloudflare. Specific endpoints have different limits:

- **Standard endpoints** (Messages, Token Counting): 32 MB
- **[Batch API](/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing)**: 256 MB
- **[Files API](/en/docs/build-with-claude/files)**: 500 MB

## Response Headers

The Anthropic API includes the following headers in every response:

- `request-id`: A globally unique identifier for the request.

- `anthropic-organization-id`: The organization ID associated with the API key used in the request.
