## How do I use Better Flow?

Authors create articles, add content with group(sport, Agriculture,...) and cover images, then stage them for admin review. Admins can approve articles for team visibility or reject them back to authors for revisions. Once approved and requirements are verified, admins publish the articles live for public access.
